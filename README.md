Unfortunately this project does not work. What I attempted to do was create a deadlock algorithm where if the system deadlocks, then the process with the most resources will be terminated. There is a resource table that keeps tracks of the resources. The resourcesa are handled in FIFO order.

Since im already late, im submitting what i have done till now.
